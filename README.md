OpenSea is always our biggest inspiration, the way it effectively built a potential platform for creators, investors, and traders is what made us to take a step ahead and create OpenOcean, an NFT Marketpalce built on Near.

Our Mission behind OpenOcean is to provide the best User experience we could ever. In the process, we could able to deliver the pretties NFT marketplace that you could ever find on the internet, and we’re proudly presenting that we’re only on Near at the moment.
